    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to effectively use reasoning models like **OpenAI's o3/o4-mini** and **Claude's Extended Thinking** for various tasks, including structured prompting, few-shot learning, and generating responses with specific policies. Below is a detailed guide to help students navigate and understand the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "This notebook is designed to teach students how to:\n",
    "* Load and configure API keys for reasoning models (OpenAI & Anthropic).\n",
    "* List available OpenAI models programmatically.\n",
    "* Apply best practices for prompting reasoning models.\n",
    "* Use structured formats and few-shot examples to improve model responses.\n",
    "* Compare different reasoning models (o3, o4-mini, o3-mini) and their costs.\n",
    "* Understand when to use reasoning models vs. regular models.\n",
    "* Leverage Claude's Extended Thinking feature for advanced reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Prerequisites\n",
    "Before running the notebook, ensure the following:\n",

    "# 4 Principles on Prompting with Reasoning Models\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with reasoning models like o3, o4-mini, and Claude with Extended Thinking, follow these four key principles:\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Keep It Simple and Direct\n",
    "Reasoning models work best with clear, straightforward prompts. Avoid unnecessary complexity or verbose instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. No Explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Required\n",
    "**Do NOT** provide step-by-step instructions like \"Think through this step by step\" or \"Let's break this down\". \n",
    "\n",
    "Reasoning models have built-in reasoning capabilities. Adding explicit CoT instructions can:\n",
    "- Interfere with the model's internal reasoning process\n",
    "- Lead to overly verbose outputs\n",
    "- Cause inaccurate results or refusals\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Bad:** \"Think through this step by step, and don't skip any steps...\"\n",
    "✅ **Good:** \"Generate a function that outputs the SMILES IDs for all the molecules involved in insulin.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Use Structured Formats\n",
    "Leverage consistent structures like XML tags or markdown to organize your inputs:\n",
    "- Helps the model parse complex instructions\n",
    "- Ensures more uniform output\n",
    "- Improves reliability in production systems\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** Use `<instructions>`, `<policy>`, `<query>` tags to structure your prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. Show Rather Than Tell (Few-Shot Learning)\n",
    "Instead of explaining what you want, provide 1-2 examples:\n",
    "- Demonstrates the desired format and style\n",
    "- Provides domain context naturally\n",
    "- Often more effective than lengthy instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** Show an example of a legal response before asking for a similar analysis."

    "</question>\n",
    "<response>\n",
    "Collaborating with a competitor on a joint marketing campaign can raise antitrust concerns under U.S. antitrust laws, particularly the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 (15 U.S.C. §§ 1–7). Section 1 of the Sherman Act prohibits any contract, combination, or conspiracy that unreasonably restrains trade or commerce among the states.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Considerations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Per Se Illegal Agreements:** Certain collaborations are considered automatically illegal (\"per se\" violations), such as price-fixing, bid-rigging, and market allocation agreements. For example, in *United States v. Topco Associates, Inc.*, 405 U.S. 596 (1972), the Supreme Court held that market division agreements between competitors are per se illegal under the Sherman Act.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Rule of Reason Analysis:** Collaborations that are not per se illegal are evaluated under the \"rule of reason,\" which assesses whether the pro-competitive benefits outweigh the anti-competitive effects. In *Broadcast Music, Inc. v. Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc.*, 441 U.S. 1 (1979), the Court recognized that certain joint ventures between competitors can be lawful if they promote competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Information Sharing Risks:** Sharing competitively sensitive information, such as pricing strategies or customer data, can lead to antitrust violations. The Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission caution against exchanges that could facilitate collusion (*Antitrust Guidelines for Collaborations Among Competitors*, 2000).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Define the Scope:** Clearly delineate the parameters of the collaboration to focus on the marketing campaign without involving competitive aspects like pricing or market division.\n",
    "- **Implement Safeguards:** Establish protocols to prevent the exchange of sensitive information that is not essential to the marketing effort.\n",
    "- **Legal Consultation:** Given the complexities of antitrust laws, consult with a legal professional to ensure the collaboration complies with all legal requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "While joint marketing campaigns between competitors are not inherently illegal, they must be structured carefully to avoid antitrust pitfalls. Legal guidance is essential to navigate these issues and to design a collaboration that achieves your business objectives without violating antitrust laws.\n",

    "## 🎓 Key Takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Keep prompts simple** - Let reasoning models figure out the steps\n",
    "2. **Don't provide explicit CoT** - It can interfere with internal reasoning\n",
    "3. **Use structured formats** - XML tags help organize complex requests\n",
    "4. **Show examples** - Few-shot learning works great with reasoning models\n",
    "5. **Choose the right model** - Consider task complexity, budget, and speed needs\n",
    "6. **Monitor costs** - Reasoning models are more expensive per token\n",
    "7. **Use Claude Extended Thinking** - When you need transparency in reasoning\n",

    "- You enable it by adding a `thinking` parameter\n",
