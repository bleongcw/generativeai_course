    "# Anthropic Model List - Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to retrieve and display a list of available models from the Anthropic AI platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running this code, make sure you have:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Installed the Anthropic Python client:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   !pip install anthropic\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Set your Anthropic API key as an environment variable:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   import os\n",
    "   os.environ[\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\"] = \"your_api_key_here\"  # Replace with your actual API key\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Alternatively, you can create a `.env` file and load it:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   from dotenv import load_dotenv\n",
    "   load_dotenv()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Retrieving and Displaying Anthropic Models\n",
    "\n",
    "The code below will:\n",
    "1. Initialize the Anthropic client\n",
    "2. Retrieve a list of available models (limited to 20)\n",
    "3. Display each model's ID and display name in a formatted way\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Import the Anthropic library\n",
    "import anthropic\n",
    "\n",
    "# Initialize the client\n",
    "client = anthropic.Anthropic()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Get the models\n",
    "models = client.models.list(limit=20)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print model ID and display name\n",
    "print(\"Available Anthropic Models:\")\n",
    "print(\"--------------------------\")\n",
    "for model in models.data:\n",
    "    print(f\"{model.id:<35} | {model.display_name}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "- The script uses the official Anthropic Python client to interact with their API\n",
    "- We limit the results to 20 models, although Anthropic typically offers fewer than that\n",
    "- For each model, we display:\n",
    "  - The model ID (e.g., \"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\") - this is what you use in API calls\n",
    "  - The human-readable display name (e.g., \"Claude 3.7 Sonnet\")\n",
    "- The `:<35` in the f-string is a formatting instruction that left-aligns the model ID text and pads it to 35 characters, creating a clean output\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expected Output\n",
    "\n",
    "When run, this code should produce output similar to:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Available Anthropic Models:\n",
    "--------------------------\n",
    "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219         | Claude 3.7 Sonnet\n",
    "claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620         | Claude 3.5 Sonnet\n",
    "claude-3-opus-20240229             | Claude 3 Opus\n",
    "claude-3-sonnet-20240229           | Claude 3 Sonnet\n",
    "claude-2.1                         | Claude 2.1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Enhanced Display (Optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want a more visually appealing display, you can use the `tabulate` library:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import anthropic\n",
    "from tabulate import tabulate\n",
    "\n",
    "# Initialize the client\n",
    "client = anthropic.Anthropic()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Get the models\n",
    "models = client.models.list(limit=20)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Prepare data for tabulation\n",
    "model_data = []\n",
    "for model in models.data:\n",
    "    # Format the date to be more readable\n",
    "    created_date = model.created_at.strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d\")\n",
    "    model_data.append([model.id, model.display_name, created_date])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print as a table\n",
    "print(tabulate(model_data, headers=[\"Model ID\", \"Display Name\", \"Created Date\"], tablefmt=\"grid\"))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure to install tabulate first with `!pip install tabulate` if you choose this option."

    "## Best Practices for Structured Outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ DO:\n",
    "- **Be explicit**: \"Respond with ONLY valid JSON\"\n",
    "- **Provide schemas**: Show the exact structure you want\n",
    "- **Give examples**: Include sample JSON in your prompt\n",
    "- **Validate outputs**: Always parse and validate the JSON\n",
    "- **Handle errors gracefully**: Use try-except for parsing\n",
    "- **Use stop sequences**: Can help ensure clean JSON generation\n",
    "\n",
    "### ❌ DON'T:\n",
    "- **Assume perfect JSON**: Always validate\n",
    "- **Use complex nested structures**: Keep it simple when possible\n",
    "- **Forget to handle code blocks**: Claude sometimes wraps JSON in markdown\n",
    "- **Skip schema definition**: Be explicit about structure\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tips for Reliable JSON\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Explicit Instructions**\n",

    "prompt = \"\"\"Return your response as valid JSON only.\n",

    "- **Always wrap API calls in try-except blocks**\n",
    "- **Use exponential backoff for rate limits** (start with 1s, double each time)\n",
    "- **Implement retry logic for transient errors** (rate limits, connection issues, 5xx errors)\n",
    "- **Log errors for debugging** (include timestamps and error details)\n",
    "- **Set reasonable timeouts** to prevent hanging requests\n",
    "- **Add delays between batch requests** to avoid rate limits\n",
    "\n",
    "### ❌ DON'T:\n",
    "- **Don't retry authentication errors** (401) - fix your API key instead\n",
    "- **Don't retry bad request errors** (400) - fix your request parameters\n",
    "- **Don't retry indefinitely** - set a max retry limit (3-5 is typical)\n",
    "- **Don't ignore errors silently** - always log or handle them\n",

    "1. **Track your usage** with the `usage` field in responses\n",
    "2. **Implement request queuing** for high-volume applications\n",
    "3. **Use Haiku models** for higher throughput (they're faster and cheaper)\n",
