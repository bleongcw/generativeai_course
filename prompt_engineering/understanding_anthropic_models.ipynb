    "# Anthropic Model List - Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to retrieve and display a list of available models from the Anthropic AI platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running this code, make sure you have:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Installed the Anthropic Python client:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   !pip install anthropic\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Set your Anthropic API key as an environment variable:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   import os\n",
    "   os.environ[\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\"] = \"your_api_key_here\"  # Replace with your actual API key\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Alternatively, you can create a `.env` file and load it:\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   from dotenv import load_dotenv\n",
    "   load_dotenv()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Retrieving and Displaying Anthropic Models\n",
    "\n",
    "The code below will:\n",
    "1. Initialize the Anthropic client\n",
    "2. Retrieve a list of available models (limited to 20)\n",
    "3. Display each model's ID and display name in a formatted way\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Import the Anthropic library\n",
    "import anthropic\n",
    "\n",
    "# Initialize the client\n",
    "client = anthropic.Anthropic()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Get the models\n",
    "models = client.models.list(limit=20)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print model ID and display name\n",
    "print(\"Available Anthropic Models:\")\n",
    "print(\"--------------------------\")\n",
    "for model in models.data:\n",
    "    print(f\"{model.id:<35} | {model.display_name}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "- The script uses the official Anthropic Python client to interact with their API\n",
    "- We limit the results to 20 models, although Anthropic typically offers fewer than that\n",
    "- For each model, we display:\n",
    "  - The model ID (e.g., \"claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219\") - this is what you use in API calls\n",
    "  - The human-readable display name (e.g., \"Claude 3.7 Sonnet\")\n",
    "- The `:<35` in the f-string is a formatting instruction that left-aligns the model ID text and pads it to 35 characters, creating a clean output\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expected Output\n",
    "\n",
    "When run, this code should produce output similar to:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Available Anthropic Models:\n",
    "--------------------------\n",
    "claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219         | Claude 3.7 Sonnet\n",
    "claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620         | Claude 3.5 Sonnet\n",
    "claude-3-opus-20240229             | Claude 3 Opus\n",
    "claude-3-sonnet-20240229           | Claude 3 Sonnet\n",
    "claude-2.1                         | Claude 2.1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Enhanced Display (Optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want a more visually appealing display, you can use the `tabulate` library:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import anthropic\n",
    "from tabulate import tabulate\n",
    "\n",
    "# Initialize the client\n",
    "client = anthropic.Anthropic()\n",
    "\n",
    "# Get the models\n",
    "models = client.models.list(limit=20)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Prepare data for tabulation\n",
    "model_data = []\n",
    "for model in models.data:\n",
    "    # Format the date to be more readable\n",
    "    created_date = model.created_at.strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d\")\n",
    "    model_data.append([model.id, model.display_name, created_date])\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print as a table\n",
    "print(tabulate(model_data, headers=[\"Model ID\", \"Display Name\", \"Created Date\"], tablefmt=\"grid\"))\n",
    "```\n",

    "Make sure to install tabulate first with `!pip install tabulate` if you choose this option."
