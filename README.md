# Description
Here is the github repository for the files which I used to teach my courses in Institute of Systems Science, National University of Singapore

## Jupyter Notebooks Overview

### prompt_engineering/prompt_engineering_day1_solution.ipynb
A comprehensive introduction to prompt engineering for large language models (LLMs) such as OpenAI's GPT-4 and Anthropic's Claude. Covers principles of prompt design, API usage, message formatting, model parameters (max_tokens, temperature, stop sequences), and system prompts. Includes hands-on code examples for both OpenAI and Anthropic APIs.

### prompt_engineering/understanding_anthropic_models.ipynb
Demonstrates how to retrieve and display a list of available models from the Anthropic AI platform using their Python client. Includes code for listing models, formatting output, and optional enhanced display with the tabulate library.

### prompt_engineering/reasoning_o1_openAI.ipynb
Focuses on advanced prompting and reasoning with OpenAI's latest models (including o1 and GPT-4 series). Shows how to list available OpenAI models, construct effective reasoning prompts, and use structured formats. Includes practical code for generating functions and outputs using reasoning models.
